# Tiny Sorter for Ardunio Uno
The current [Tiny Sorter](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/tiny-sorter/view) requires Arduino Leonardo due to the WebUSB compatibilty issue. 
Implementing a code change to the serial.js to accept an Arduino Uno should be pretty straight forward.

# WIP: Currently this is just a collection of resources to complete the "quest"

# Resources
1) [Tiny Sorter](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/tiny-sorter/view) - original source
2) [P5 Serial library](https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialport) - serial library
3) you'll need to run the [p5.serialcontrol](https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialcontrol/releases) app on your local machine so that you can properly connect arduino uno to p5 web editor 
4) Pull exmaple connnection from [P5ReadSerial](https://github.com/ITPNYU/physcomp/tree/master/Labs/P5SerialLabs/P5ReadSerial/readSerial) we're just looking for connectivity
5) get [SerialSend](https://github.com/ITPNYU/physcomp/tree/master/Labs/P5SerialLabs/P5SendSerial)
